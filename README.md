# Integrative Analysis and Early Detection of Student Depression Using Clustering and Logistic Regression

## Description

Project aims to provide an integrative framework for understanding and identifying depression among students by leveraging both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. Using a dataset that encompasses demographic information, academic metrics, lifestyle indicators, and mental health data, the project develops a predictive model for early detection of student depression while also uncovering distinct student profiles.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each student.
- **Gender**: Gender of the student.
- **Age**: Age of the student.
- **City**: Geographic region.
- **Profession**: Typically "Student".
- **Academic Pressure**: Numerical score representing academic pressure.
- **Work Pressure**: Numerical score representing work-related pressure.
- **CGPA**: Academic performance as a cumulative grade point average.
- **Study Satisfaction**: A numerical rating of satisfaction with study routines.
- **Job Satisfaction**: A numerical rating of satisfaction with job-related aspects (if applicable).
- **Sleep Duration**: Categorical text (e.g., '5-6 hours', 'Less than 5 hours', '7-8 hours', 'More than 8 hours').
- **Dietary Habits**: Qualitative descriptor of the student's diet (e.g., Healthy, Moderate).
- **Degree**: The degree or level of education pursued.
- **Have you ever had suicidal thoughts ?**: Indicator of past suicidal ideation.
- **Work/Study Hours**: Number of hours spent on work/study.
- **Financial Stress**: Numerical score representing financial strain.
- **Family History of Mental Illness**: Binary indicator for a family history of mental illness.
- **Depression**: Binary target variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of depression.

## Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**  
  Clean and transform the raw data, including mapping categorical values (e.g., Sleep Duration) to numerical representations, handling missing values, and ensuring correct data types.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Generate statistical summaries, distribution plots, and correlation matrices to understand the relationships between variables.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Synthesize new features such as a *Stress Score* (combining academic and work pressure) and a *Lifestyle Balance* metric (a composite of sleep duration, study satisfaction, and job satisfaction) to capture underlying patterns related to student well-being.

- **Clustering Analysis:**  
  Apply K-Means clustering (augmented by PCA visualization) to segment students into distinct groups. Cluster profiling is performed to derive domain-specific insights such as "High Stress / Moderate Sleep / High CGPA" versus "Moderate Stress / High Sleep / Lower CGPA".

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Build a logistic regression model to predict student depression. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score to ensure its reliability in identifying at-risk individuals.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
   - Convert categorical values and remove extraneous characters from textual fields.
   - Map sleep duration categories to numeric values and impute missing data.
   - Ensure numerical consistency across all features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Generate summary statistics, histograms, boxplots, and correlation matrices.
   - Understand the distribution and relationships in the data to guide subsequent modeling.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Compute a *Stress Score* by averaging academic and work pressures.
   - Create a *Lifestyle Balance* index using a weighted combination of standardized sleep duration, study satisfaction, and job satisfaction scores.

4. **Clustering:**  
   - Use K-Means to segment the dataset into meaningful clusters based on key features.
   - Apply PCA to reduce dimensions for visualization.
   - Generate cluster profiles (mean and standard deviation for each cluster) and assign domain-specific labels based on the grouping characteristics.

5. **Predictive Modeling:**  
   - Train a logistic regression model with an emphasis on achieving high recall for the depressed class.
   - Assess model performance using cross-validation and classification metrics.

## Conclusion

This project presents an end-to-end analytical framework that integrates clustering-based profiling with logistic regression for predicting student depression. The dual approach not only facilitates the identification of meaningful student groups but also provides a predictive tool for early intervention. The insights generated by the model and cluster analysis offer a balanced perspective on the factors contributing to depression, enabling data-driven decisions that could potentially support mental health initiatives in academic settings.
